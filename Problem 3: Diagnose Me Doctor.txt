### **Steps to Troubleshoot High Memory Usage on the NGINX Load Balancer VM**

Below are the steps to troubleshoot, potential root causes, impacts, and recovery steps.


## **Step 1: Verify Memory Usage**
1. **Check Memory Usage**:
   - Use the `free -h` command to confirm memory usage.
   - Use `top` or `htop` to identify processes consuming the most memory.

2. **Check NGINX Memory Usage**:
   - Use `ps aux | grep nginx` to check memory usage by NGINX worker processes.
   - NGINX typically uses minimal memory per worker (e.g., 10-20MB). If memory usage is abnormally high, it could indicate a misconfiguration or issue.


## **Step 2: Check NGINX Configuration**
1. **Review NGINX Configuration**:
   - Inspect the NGINX configuration file (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) for misconfigurations.
   - Look for:
     - High `worker_connections` values.
     - Excessive caching configurations.
     - Large buffer sizes (e.g., `proxy_buffer_size`, `client_body_buffer_size`).

2. **Check Open File Descriptors**:
   - Use `lsof -p <nginx_pid>` to check the number of open file descriptors.
   - If the number is excessively high, it could indicate a resource leak.


## **Step 3: Check System Logs**
1. **Review System Logs**:
   - Check `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` for memory-related errors or warnings.
   - Look for OOM (Out of Memory) killer logs.

2. **Review NGINX Logs**:
   - Check `/var/log/nginx/error.log` for errors or warnings.
   - Look for signs of excessive requests or upstream failures.


## **Step 4: Check Traffic Patterns**
1. **Analyze Traffic**:
   - Use `nginx -T` to check active connections (`active_connections`).
   - Use `netstat` or `ss` to monitor incoming connections.
   - Use tools like `iftop` or `nload` to analyze network traffic.

2. **Check for DDoS or High Traffic**:
   - If traffic is abnormally high, it could overwhelm NGINX and cause high memory usage.


## **Step 5: Check for Resource Leaks**
1. **Inspect NGINX Workers**:
   - Use `strace -p <nginx_worker_pid>` to trace system calls and identify potential leaks.
   - Look for repeated allocations or unclosed file descriptors.

2. **Check for Zombie Processes**:
   - Use `ps aux | grep Z` to check for zombie processes.
   - Zombie processes can consume memory and resources.


## **Step 6: Check for External Factors**
1. **Inspect Upstream Services**:
   - If upstream services are slow or unresponsive, NGINX may buffer responses, leading to high memory usage.
   - Use `curl` or `nginx -t` to test upstream connectivity.

2. **Check for Malicious Activity**:
   - Inspect logs for signs of brute force attacks or malicious requests.
   - Use tools like `fail2ban` to block suspicious IPs.


## **Potential Root Causes, Impacts, and Recovery Steps**

### **1. Misconfigured NGINX**
- **Cause**:
  - High `worker_connections` or excessive buffer sizes.
  - Improper caching configurations.
- **Impact**:
  - NGINX consumes more memory than necessary, leading to high memory usage.
- **Recovery**:
  - Adjust `worker_connections` and buffer sizes in the NGINX configuration.
  - Restart NGINX: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.


### **2. High Traffic or DDoS Attack**
- **Cause**:
  - Sudden spike in traffic or a DDoS attack.
- **Impact**:
  - NGINX struggles to handle the load, leading to high memory usage and potential service degradation.
- **Recovery**:
  - Implement rate limiting in NGINX:
    ```nginx
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=10r/s;
    ```
  - Use a CDN or WAF (e.g., AWS WAF, Cloudflare) to mitigate DDoS attacks.


### **3. Resource Leaks in NGINX**
- **Cause**:
  - Memory or file descriptor leaks in NGINX.
- **Impact**:
  - Memory usage grows over time, eventually exhausting system resources.
- **Recovery**:
  - Restart NGINX to release leaked resources: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`.
  - Upgrade to the latest stable version of NGINX to fix known bugs.


### **4. Upstream Service Issues**
- **Cause**:
  - Upstream services are slow or unresponsive, causing NGINX to buffer responses.
- **Impact**:
  - NGINX buffers consume memory, leading to high memory usage.
- **Recovery**:
  - Optimize upstream services to reduce response times.
  - Adjust NGINX buffer sizes:
    ```nginx
    proxy_buffer_size 4k;
    proxy_buffers 8 16k;
    ```


### **5. System-Level Issues**
- **Cause**:
  - Memory leaks in the kernel or other system processes.
- **Impact**:
  - System memory is exhausted, affecting all processes, including NGINX.
- **Recovery**:
  - Reboot the VM to clear memory leaks.
  - Update the kernel and system packages to the latest versions.
