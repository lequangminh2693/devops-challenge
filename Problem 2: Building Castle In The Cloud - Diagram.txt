II. Architecture Overview
  The system is designed using a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance. The architecture is divided into several key components:

    1. Frontend: User interface for trading, account management, and analytics.

    2. API Gateway: Central entry point for all client requests.

    3. Order Matching Engine: Core service for matching buy/sell orders.

    4. User Management: Handles authentication, authorization, and user data.

    5. Wallet Service: Manages cryptocurrency wallets and transactions.

    6. Market Data Service: Provides real-time market data (e.g., prices, order books).

    7. Database Layer: Stores user data, orders, and transaction history.

    8. Cache Layer: Improves performance for frequently accessed data.

    9. Message Queue: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services.

    10. Monitoring and Logging: Ensures observability and fault detection.
